Upgrades installed packages to their latest versions (sudo apt upgrade).

3. Install Git
bash
Copy
sudo apt install git
Installs Git, a version control system, which may be required for downloading or managing repositories.

4. Install AIS-Catcher
bash
Copy
sudo bash -c "$(wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abcd567a/install-aiscatcher/master/install-aiscatcher.sh)"
Downloads and runs the install-aiscatcher.sh script from the abcd567a/install-aiscatcher GitHub repository.

This script installs AIS-Catcher and its dependencies.

5. Test AIS-Catcher Installation
bash
Copy
AIS-catcher -L # test installation
Runs the AIS-catcher command with the -L flag to list available devices.

This is a quick test to ensure the installation was successful.

6. Compile usbreset Utility
bash
Copy
cc -o usbreset usbreset.c
Compiles a C program (usbreset.c) into an executable named usbreset.

This utility is likely used to reset USB devices, which may be necessary for AIS-Catcher to function properly.

7. Copy Configuration Files
bash
Copy
sudo cp ubiais.service /etc/systemd/system
sudo cp ubiais-script.sh /usr/local/bin
sudo cp aiscatcher.conf /usr/share/aiscatcher
Copies three files to their respective locations:

ubiais.service: A systemd service file to manage AIS-Catcher as a background service.

ubiais-script.sh: A script that likely contains commands to start AIS-Catcher.

aiscatcher.conf: A configuration file for AIS-Catcher.

8. Set Up and Enable System Service
bash
Copy
sudo systemctl start ubiais.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable ubiais.service
sudo systemctl status ubiais.service
sudo systemctl start ubiais.service: Starts the ubiais.service.

sudo systemctl daemon-reload: Reloads the systemd manager configuration to apply changes.

sudo systemctl enable ubiais.service: Ensures the service starts automatically on system boot.

sudo systemctl status ubiais.service: Displays the status of the service to verify it is running correctly.

Summary
This script automates the installation and configuration of AIS-Catcher, making it easy to set up and run the software as a system service. It handles dependencies, compiles utilities, and ensures the service is enabled and running.
